Early dropout warning system
* A dropout before time caution system enables institutes to precautionary spot students who are at risk of dropping out of foundation, to swiftly react to them, and ultimately to facilitate would-be dropout students to carry on their learning for an enhanced future. On the other hand, the intrinsic class inequity between dropout and non-dropout students could pose complicatedness in structuring precise extrapolative modeling for a dropout early warning scheme. The current study is designed to recover the feat of a dropout early warning system.‚Äù
